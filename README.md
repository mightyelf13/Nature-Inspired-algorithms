# Nature-Inspired Algorithms
Programmed in Python

This repository contains implementations of nature-inspired computational techniques.  
Each sub-directory focuses on a specific algorithm, with its own documentation, experiments, and code.  
The goal is to study how biological, physical, and evolutionary processes can be modeled and applied to solve optimization and learning problems.

## Structure

Each folder includes:
- a standalone algorithm implementation
- a dedicated `README.md` with explanation, usage, and references
- optional experiment scripts and visualizations

Examples of algorithm families featured in this project:
- evolutionary strategies
- swarm-based optimization
- neural evolution
- stochastic search heuristics

## Usage

Navigate into any algorithm’s folder and refer to its README for setup and execution details.

```bash
cd algorithm_folder/
python main.py
